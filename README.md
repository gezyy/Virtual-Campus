# Virtual-Campus
This is a project for Android version virtual campus of first edition
## Weekly Meetings
Because we will have V-room weekly meetings, so we can share our progress during the meeting, if anyone cannot attend the meeting, you can post it in our V-room chanel on MS teams.
If need, we might have meetings only for TSD memebers.
## Important Issues
Please follow the deadline, because we need to finish everything at the end of Jan.
If you have any technical problems or questions just ask others, for example you can send it into TSD group chat. Help each other is good.
There is no strict rules for the contents included in the project(except something terrible)so you can decide what you want to show, and make sure you can finish it.
For starting your developing, you can using the virtual campus scene(only have models)which I already uploaded here.
## Integrate
For integrating, before the deadline for finishing partially tasks(1.30), we need to upload the package of the whole project include your tasks, all the documents, models, etc. Just export the whole thing include the scenes. Then upload it.
Make sure we can find you because when doing integration, some problems may happens, so we need communication.
## Test
This first testing only can be dong by V-room memebers, and our goal is to find the bugs, problems, something can be improved as more as possible, and we will have a collection form.
## Improve
After testing, we will improve our project, also need test many times but can be quicker.
